# OneFuzz - A self-hosted Fuzzing-As-A-Service platform

Project OneFuzz enables continuous developer-driven fuzzing to proactively
harden software prior to release.  With a single command, which can be baked
into CICD, developers can launch fuzz jobs from a few virtual machines to
thousands of cores.
